Verse 1]

Everybody knows my name now

But something 'bout it still feels strange

Like looking in the mirror

Tryna steady yourself and seeing somebody else

And everything is not the same now

It feels like all our lives have changed

Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down

But it's killing me now


[Pre-Chorus]

What if you had it all but nobody to call?

Maybe then you'd know me

'Cause I've had everything

But no one's listening

And that's just fucking lonely


[Chorus]

I'm so lo-o-o-onely

Lo-o-o-onely


[Verse 2]

Everybody knows my past now

Like my house was always made of glass

And maybe that's the price you pay

For the money and fame at an early age

And everybody saw me sick

And it felt like no one gave a shit

They criticized the things I did

As an idiot kid



[Pre-Chorus]

What if you had it all but nobody to call?

Maybe then you'd know me

'Cause I've had everything

But no one's listening

And that's just fucking lonely


[Chorus]

I'm so lo-o-o-onely

Lo-o-o-onely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely

Lo-o-o-onely
