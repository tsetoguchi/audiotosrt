 《Baremo》

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 《Baremo》が生まれた時から 男人話の主人公なのさ

3
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:44,000
出逢いや別れ繰り返し

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:59,000
この世界が幻でもいい

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:16,000
人生はまるでファンタジア

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 人生はきっとファンタシア 僕らの想像がいつの日か未来を変えてゆくのさ

7
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:56,000
拍手をして僕らを讃える

8
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:12,000
どうせなら楽しんでやれ

9
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:30,000
人生はまるでファンタジア

10
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 人生はきっとファンタシア 僕らの想像がいつの日か誰かを笑顔にするはず

11
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:20,000
人生はまるでファンタジア

12
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 人生はきっとファンタシア 僕らの想像がいつの日か未来を変えてゆくのさ

13
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
未来を変えてゆくのさ

14
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Life is like Fantasy

18
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Even though everyone lives such fleeting lives

19
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Wherever this planet is, there is a struggle today

20
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Look, the night sky shines

21
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 The petals are flying up

22
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I want to burn your happy face

23
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Even if it's a momentary illusion

24
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 A boy who was with me hundreds of years ago

25
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Is surely a girl like you

26
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And will fall in love again

27
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Even if the world ends

28
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 We will never forget

29
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 The days I lived with you

30
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And the way you looked at me

31
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Even if it's a momentary dream

32
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 The joy of loving each other

33
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 The heart of forgiving each other

34
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Will it reach the future?

35
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Look, the night sky shines

36
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 The petals are flying up

37
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I want to burn your happy face

38
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Even if it's a momentary illusion

39
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 The heart of forgiving each other

40
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Even if it's a momentary illusion

41
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I won't let go of your hand

42
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Hold me tight

45
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 The weak heart that I've accumulated for a long time

46
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Has become a mountain

47
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 The higher it goes, the more it reaches the atmosphere

48
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I can't see it anymore

49
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 All of that, break it down

50
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I'll go on a trip again

51
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Are we still dreaming?

52
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I'm looking for the best partner

53
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Who I've never seen before

54
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I cried and laughed

55
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I'm aiming for the treasure of hope

56
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 On rainy days and rainy days

57
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I'll sing the song of adventure

 If you can't move by lining up the excuses and excuses

60
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I'll leave you

61
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I don't have time to regret

62
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I'll go on a trip again

63
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000

68
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Tonight

69
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Are we still dreaming?

70
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I'm looking for the best partner

71
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000

 I'm looking for the best partner

82
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Shouji, it's so wide

83
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 It was wider than I thought

84
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Everyone

85
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 What should I call that area?

86
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Is it a stand?

87
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Stop the season in the sun

88
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I can hear you a little late

89
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Is that so?

90
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 But is it going to be three times?

91
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 It's going to be three times

92
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Thank you for sending us so much love today

93
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Thank you

94
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Today is December 25th

95
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 It's Christmas

96
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Are you going on a date?

97
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Are you here to see Shouji Santa?

98
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I'm here to see Yoji Tonakai

99
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 He's a big fan of Hire Carol

100
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Thank you for giving us this day

101
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 on Christmas, December 25th

102
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 at the live performance of Narita Tomo Simpson's Yakanobuntai

103
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 We're so glad you gave us this day

104
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 We're going to send you a lot of love

105
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Today is a live broadcast

106
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 It's already broadcasted

107
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Please turn to the camera

108
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Where is the camera?

109
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Is it here?

110
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Thank you for watching the live broadcast

111
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 It's December 25th

112
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 It's a very precious day

113
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Thank you for watching the live broadcast

114
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 We're receiving your love

115
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Shouji is very smooth today

116
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 He's talking

117
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I'm going to put some honey on it

118
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Today is our tour final

119
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 We have a wonderful guest

120
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He's going to be our Christmas present

121
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Thank you for watching until the end

122
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 We, Narita Tomo Simpson, released our second album, Fantasia, on November 29th

123
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Did you hear that?

124
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Please give a round of applause

125
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 It's been heard all over the world

126
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Wait, let's do it again

127
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 We released our second album, Fantasia, on November 20th

128
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Did you hear that?

129
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Shouji, we're like the most popular group

130
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 It feels good

131
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 It feels like I'm dreaming

132
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Today, we're going to listen to Shouji's song

133
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Let's hear it

134
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 We're going to play it, One Way

135
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
One Way

136
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I've been trying to figure it out

137
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 I can't reset it

138
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 It's a reality

139
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Dreams are magic

140
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 I'm stopping my feet

141
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I don't believe in you

142
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 It doesn't start, going one way

143
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 It doesn't start, going one way

144
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 I'm drawing in the transparent rain

145
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I'm losing it

146
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I can't fix my brilliant childhood dream

147
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 When I forget, I remember

148
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I've been living it somehow

149
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I'm trying to figure it out

150
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I'm losing it

151
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I can't fix my brilliant childhood dream

152
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 When I forget, I remember

153
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 I'm losing it

154
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 I can't fix my brilliant childhood dream

155
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 When I forget, I remember

156
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I've been trying to figure it out

157
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I can't reset it

158
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 It's a reality

159
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Dreams are magic

160
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 I'm stopping my feet

161
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 I don't believe in you

162
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It doesn't start, going one way

163
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 It doesn't start, going one way

164
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I'm drawing in the transparent rain

165
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I don't believe in you

166
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 It doesn't start, going one way

167
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It doesn't start, going one way

168
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 It doesn't start, going one way

169
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 It doesn't start, going one way

170
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Thank you

171
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 It's going to ring

172
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Now, it's time for Christmas

173
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Shall we start the song?

174
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 It's suddenly started

175
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Another song from the FANTASIA

176
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I'll sing GOODBYE

177
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Christmas Song

178
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 A city with a glass-glassed, shining city

179
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 A Christmas song from the radio

180
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I gently throw it away at the end of love

181
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I muttered, it's so sad

182
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 The love-pushing, even the lies

183
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Ah, at midnight, the fantasy melts

184
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Under the snow dyed in neon

185
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I wait for spring forever

186
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Counting my fingers, the light is on

187
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 It's strong, but I can't turn back

188
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Now, I'll sing GOODBYE to you

189
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Your dream, many times

190
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Christmas rose on the window

191
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 If I close my eyes, I'll surely feel proud

192
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 It's painful not to wake up

193
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Is it the answer to the love's goodbye?

194
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Ah, the more I reach out, the more I see the blue bird

195
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Under the moonlight, I wait for morning forever

196
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Counting my fingers, the light is on

197
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 It's strong, but I can't turn back

198
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Now, I'll sing GOODBYE to you

199
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 The love-pushing, even the lies

200
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Ah, at midnight, the fantasy melts

201
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Under the snow dyed in neon

202
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I wait for spring forever

203
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Counting my fingers, the light is on

204
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 It's strong, but I can't turn back

205
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Now, I'll sing GOODBYE to you

206
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 The Love-Pushing, Even the Lies

207
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I don't want to be kind anymore

208
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 I see you with a tired face

209
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I see you with a tired face

210
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 While reflecting his distant face in my eyes

211
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 I saw you smiling beside him for a long time

212
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I understand the words you want

213
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 I don't mind if it's unfair

214
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Don't get lost, come here

215
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Come into my heart

216
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Don't forget, it's okay

217
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Now, rest your wings

218
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Let's hold each other tight until we remember everything

219
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 The Love-Pushing, Even the Lies

220
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 He's already in love with someone else

221
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 He knows a new life

222
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 It's okay now, you say it

223
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 But you're still in my heart

224
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Don't get lost, come here

225
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Throw away everything

226
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I'll wipe away your tears

227
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And make you smile

228
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 I'll wait forever

229
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Until the day we remember everything

230
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Don't get lost, come here

231
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Come into my heart

232
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Don't get lost, just look straight at me

233
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Let's hold each other tight until we remember everything

234
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 The Love-Pushing, Even the Lies

235
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 The Love-Pushing, Even the Lies

236
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Without saying goodbye, only time passes

237
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 I'm drawn to the words that are swallowed by tears

238
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Someday, I'm sure I'll be able to look up at the blue sky with a smile

239
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 I bite down on it while I believe

240
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I'll cross yesterday's small wishes and go to tomorrow

241
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 I won't erase the big mistakes and mistakes

242
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 If life is a path of hope

243
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 The Love-Pushing, Even the Lies

244
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Without answering, I wait for dawn

245
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I'm falling apart, I'm looking at regret

246
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 I'm digging my pockets, what kind of face will I make now?

247
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 I bite down on it while I touch it

248
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 I'll cross yesterday's small wishes and go to tomorrow

249
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 I won't forget the big fights and betrayals

250
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 If life is a path of hope

251
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 The Love-Pushing, Even the Lies

252
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 I'll cross yesterday's small wishes and go to tomorrow

253
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 I won't erase the big mistakes and mistakes

254
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 I won't erase the small peace and prayers

255
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 I won't forget the big fights and betrayals

256
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 If life is a path of hope

257
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 The Love-Pushing, Even the Lies

258
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Big Band Beef

259
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 One, two, one, two, three, four

260
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 The Love-Pushing, Even the Lies

261
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Look at the crying kids, they laugh when they notice

262
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 No matter where in the world, it will reach in an instant

263
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 The beginning of a show with a mysterious power

264
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 The bass is shaking when the drums and I play the rhythm

265
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 When I ring the guitar, I'll sing with a voice

266
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 Big Band Girls, I'll make a beat

267
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Look at the worried adults, they remember those days

268
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 If I can get a little courage, I can be anything

269
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 Tonight, I'll start the show on the stage of Yokohama

270
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 The drums and I play the rhythm

271
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 The bass is shaking when the drums and I play the rhythm

272
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 When I ring the guitar, I'll sing with a voice

273
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 Big Band Girls, I'll make a beat

274
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 The beginning of a show with a mysterious power

275
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 The drums and I play the rhythm

276
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 The bass is shaking when the drums and I play the beat

277
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 When I ring the guitar, I'll sing with a voice

278
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Big Band Girls, I'll make a beat

279
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Big Band We will play!

280
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Big Band We will play!

281
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 Please say, what?

282
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Too fast?

283
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Narita Thomas Simpson is a summer band

284
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 Hideki, Shoji and I met on the surf

285
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 We are a summer band

286
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 We only play in summer, we don't play in winter

287
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Shoji is also in the sea for two thirds of a year

288
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 Of course, I came here by swimming

289
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 You came by taxi

290
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 I went by taxi to the sea and swam

291
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 I still have a wet suit on

292
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Yes, we only play in summer

293
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Please listen to Narita Thomas Simpson's summer song

294
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Please listen to Narita Thomas Simpson's summer song

295
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Stop the season in the sun

296
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 Please take my heart

297
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 I want to stay like this forever

298
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Stop the season, You’re my dream

299
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Don't pass by the south wind

300
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 I can't do it, my feelings feel so blue

301
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 Big Band Girls, I'll make a beat

302
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Wait, wait

303
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 That's a song for people, Shoji

304
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 You play live every year at Yokohama Stadium in Kannai

305
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 It's a summer band

306
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Please play our representative song

307
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Please play our representative song

308
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 I said I like you in the middle of the night

309
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 I took you into my dreams

310
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 I can't forget the blue sky

311
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 I can't become your voice

312
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Stop the season in the sun

313
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Where does the wave go?

314
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Love & Love that passes by

315
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 Love is as it is

316
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Love & Love that passes by

317
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 Wait, wait, wait

318
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 It's a super band that Kanagawa created

319
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 I've been doing this for a long time

320
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 But today is the day of the aurora

321
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 It's Christmas

322
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 I said I only play summer songs

323
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 But this is our first Christmas song

324
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 I felt like I could hold hands forever

325
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 Everything was shining

326
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Stop the season, You’re my dream

327
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 I was afraid that you would disappear

328
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 I realized that I love people

329
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 Merry Christmas someday

330
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Yokohama Stadium

331
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 Yokohama!

332
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 We're going to introduce our best teammates

333
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 Are you ready?

334
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 Takahashi Kazuya, Maeda Toyo, Okamoto Genji

335
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Yokohama!

336
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 We are Rock On!

337
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 Yokohama Stadium

338
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Yokohama Stadium

339
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 Yokohama Stadium

340
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 I still smell the scent of the mist

341
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 When I close my eyes, I feel the scent of citrus

342
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 The smell of the citrus

343
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 The taste of the water that flows through my wet body

344
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 Was that an illusion?

345
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 You're not here anymore

346
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 Ever since the history took you away

347
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 No one could love you more than that

348
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 The waves are coming to me

349
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 I want to hold you

350
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Your long hair fluttering in the wind

351
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 The twilight of summer

352
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 Your skin is dyed orange

353
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 I wanted to drown with you

354
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 Before the magic of summer melts

355
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 Before the magic of summer melts

356
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 Yokohama!

357
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 Can you hear me?

358
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Hey!

359
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 Hey!

360
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 Hey!

361
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 Hey!

362
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 Hey!

363
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 Hey!

364
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 Hey!

365
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Hey!

366
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 Hey!

367
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 Hey!

368
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Hey!

369
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 Hey!

370
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 Hey!

371
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 Hey!

372
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 Hey!

373
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 Hey!

374
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Hey!

375
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 Hey!

376
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 Hey!

377
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 Hey!

378
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 Hey!

379
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 Hey!

380
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 Hey!

381
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Hey!

382
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 Hey!

383
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 Hey!

384
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 Hey!

385
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 Hey!

386
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 Hey!

387
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 Yokohama!

388
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 I'll introduce you again.

389
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 Kazuya Takahashi!

390
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 Koyo Maeda!

391
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 Keiichi Okamoto!

392
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 Please do that.

393
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 Kazuya.

394
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 We are.

395
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 Alright!

396
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 We are...

397
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 Kazuya!

398
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 We are!

399
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 Shoji-san...

400
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 Shoji-san...

401
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 It's been a while since we've all gathered together.

402
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 They are...

403
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 They are...

404
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 They are just swallowing us up.

405
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 Well...

406
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 Thank you very much for today.

407
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 Really...

408
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Everyone, Merry Christmas!

409
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 Merry Christmas!

410
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 This Christmas...

411
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 I'm so happy that we're reunited.

412
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 I'm so happy.

413
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 It's great to see you all again.

414
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 This summer has been with us all the time.

415
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 This summer, in 2020.

416
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 I hope we can go on another trip like this.

417
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 Yeah!

418
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 Right?

419
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 Shoji-san...

420
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 The lead...

421
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 The lead is...

422
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 Narita Tomo Shibu-san.

423
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 There are three of us.

424
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 Talk to him.

425
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 But, I think Hideki wants to hear your voice today.

426
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 I want to hear Hideki's voice!

427
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 It's okay.

428
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 You can talk to him.

429
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 Well, as I always say...

430
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 We've been together for the winter.

431
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 Everyone...

432
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 You're so powerful.

433
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 So powerful.

434
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 I feel so relieved...

435
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 To have you here.

436
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 Koyama-san, you were jumping around.

437
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Stop the season in the sun

438
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 Yeah.

439
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 I was worried about my knee.

440
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 Your knee was hurting.

441
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 It's getting better.

442
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 It's getting better.

443
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
 Please don't break it.

444
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 I was surprised.

445
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 We prepared matching outfits.

446
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 I see.

447
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 We've been doing this for a long time.

448
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 It's the first time we've been wearing matching outfits.

449
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 Can the four of you line up?

450
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 Cool.

451
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 I'll feel this in the Sports History tomorrow.

452
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 It's the first time we're wearing matching outfits.

453
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 So, like this...

454
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 Are you going to get a little more excited?

455
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 Are you going to get a little more excited with rock music?

456
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 Rock music.

457
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 Yokohama!

458
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 I want to hear your voices!

459
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 Can you let me hear your voices?

460
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 Third floor!

461
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 It's about the third floor.

462
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 It's about the second floor!

463
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 And the stand!

464
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
The Show Man

465
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 Arena!

466
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 Let me hear your voices!

467
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 The members, follow me!

468
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 Let's go!

469
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 Soiya! Soiya! Soiya!

470
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 Let's go with the fast one.

471
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 Yokohama Dasogare!

472
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 Yokohama Dasogare!

473
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 Yokohama Dasogare!

474
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 Yokohama Dasogare!

475
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 Yokohama Kinbay!

476
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 Yokohama Kinbay!

477
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
 Yokohama Kinbay!

478
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 Yokohama Chuka-gai!

479
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 Yokohama Chuka-gai!

480
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 I like rock music.

481
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
 I like rock music.

482
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 I like rock music.

483
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 I like Noel Shoji.

484
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 I like Noel Shoji.

485
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 I like rock music.

486
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 I like Naritomo.

487
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 One, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, show me

488
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 One, two, three, four

489
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The Show Man

490
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
 That day's guitar was a blast

491
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 I played it all day until morning

492
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 I thought I could change the world that this guy had

493
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 But I couldn't sleep because I was so excited

494
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 The walls of words are also in one go

495
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
 It's a magic that can surpass everything

496
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 I shout out with my voice hoarse

497
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
 When I play the guitar with my voice hoarse

498
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 That's the world's best friend

499
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 I love you rock and roll

500
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 I'm in love with you

501
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 I love you rock and roll

502
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 Ever since that day

503

 I love you rock and roll

504
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 From now on, I'm all in one

505
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 I love you rock and roll

506
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 Let me be your guide

507
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
 Our love words

508
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 I love you rock and roll

509
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 I love you rock and roll

510
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 Until I die, rock and roll

511
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 From now on, I'm all in one

512
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 I love you rock and roll

513
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 Let me be your guide

514
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
 Our love words

515
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
 I love you rock and roll

516
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 Until I die, rock and roll

517
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 Until I die, rock and roll

518
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 Until I die, rock and roll

519
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 Until I die, rock and roll

520
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 It's not over yet

521
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 Let's go break rock and roll

522
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 The band starts off in promote

523
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 I love you yakohama

524
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 I'm in love with you

525
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 I love you yakohama

526
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 Ever since that day

527
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 I love you yakohama

528
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
 From now on, I'm all in one

529
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 I love you Yokohama

530
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 Let me be absorbed

531
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 Our love words

532
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 I love you Rock'n'Roll

533
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 Until death, Rock'n'roll

534
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 I love you Rock'n'roll

535
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
 I love you Rock'n'roll

536
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 I love you Rock'n'roll

537
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 I love you Rock'n'roll

538
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 Yokohama

539
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 Oh yes

540
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 Oh yes

541
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 Oh yes

542
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
 Oh yes

543
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 Yes

544
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 Yes

545
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 Yes

546
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
 Yes

547
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 Yes

548
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 I love you Rock'n'roll

549
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 I love you Rock'n'roll

550
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 The coffee is in the coffee shop

551
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
The Show Man

552
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
 Do you want a point?

553
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 Was it okay?

554
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 I noticed that this group

555
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
 Is full of points

556
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 I have to stop

557
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
 I treat them like angels

558
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
 I don't want to do anything different from everyone

559
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 It's better to be carried away by the long things

560
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 Yokohama

561
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
 Give me a point

562
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 Give me a point

563
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
 Give me a point

564
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
 That's the spirit

565
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
 Give me a point

566
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 Give me a point

567
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 Give me a point

568
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 Give me more

569
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 But I don't want to do anything different from everyone

570
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
 Give me a point

571
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
 Give me a point

572
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 Even if you throw gasoline

573
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
 Even if you ride a plane

574
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
 You will be chased by a pile of coins

575
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
 If it's a chance, for the sake of the world

576
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
 Let's find something we can do

577
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
 Give me more

578
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 Give me a point

579
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 Give me a point

580
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 Give me a point

581
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
 That's the spirit

582
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
 Give me a point

583
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
 Give me a point

584
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
 Give me a point

585
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
 Give me more

586
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 Let's save a lot of points

587
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 Use all the points

588
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 Thank you, thank you

589
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 Go go go

590
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 You're going to move

591
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 Let's go! That's the way to go!

592
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 Let's use more points!

593
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 Let's use more points!

594
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 Let's use more points!

595
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 Let's use more points!

596
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
 Let's use up all the points

597
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
 Let's use up all the points

598
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 Come on!

599
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 Let's raise it! Let's raise it!

600
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
 Let's raise it! Let's raise it!

601
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 Yokohama!

602
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 Yokohama!

603
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
 Ice Shabu Shabu!

604
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
 Oh my God! Aoi Yamahideki is coming!

605
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 Let's go!

606
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
 Let's go!

607
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
 Let's go!

608
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
 Let's go!

609
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 Let's go!

610
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
 Let's go!

611
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
 Let's go!

612
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
 Let's go!

613
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 Let's go!

614
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 Let's go!

615
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
 Let's go!

616
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 Let's go!

617
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
 Let's go!

618
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
 Let's go!

619
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 Let's go!

620
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 Go, Wai Yatou!

621
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
 Go, Wai Yatou!

622
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
 Thank you!

623
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
 Thank you for the encore!

624
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
 Actually, during this Naritoma tour,

625
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,000
 both me and the boys debuted in 1988.

626
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
 About 20 years ago, the group sound boom was going on.

627
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
 We thought that was cool,

628
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
 so we were doing a medley during the Naritoma tour.

629
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 So today, can we do rock-on?

630
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
 Rock-on and Naritoma, GS Medley DD!

631
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
@ YOKOHAMA BUNTAI

632
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
 Today is Christmas!

633
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
 On this special day,

634
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
 we have a special guest!

635
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
 Are you ready?

636
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
 We have a big respect for

637
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
 Mr. Entertainment,

638
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
 Sakai Masaki!

639
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
 He's a great singer!

640
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
 He's a great singer!

641
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
 He's a great singer!

642
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
 He's a great singer!

643
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
 He's a great singer!

644
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
 He's a great singer!

645
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
 He's a great singer!

646
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
 He's a great singer!

647
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 He's a great singer!

648
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
 He's a great singer!

01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
 He's a great singer!

 He's a great singer!

653
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
 He's a great singer!

654
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
 Everybody, let's go!

655
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
 See you later!

656
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
 Let's go!

657
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
 One, two, three, four!

658
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
 One, two, three, four!

659
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
 One, two, three, four!

660
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
 One, two, three, four!

661
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
 Awesome!

662
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
 Beautiful!

663
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,600
 Cool all

664
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000

 It's a two-way road, ba-ba-ba

668
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
 Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

 Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

670
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
 Hey!

671
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
 A bruised face, ba-ba-ba

672
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
 Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

673
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
 I can't stand him

674
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
 I'm a naughty boy

675
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
 Oh, boy

 《Boku no Kokoro》

691
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:22,000
あの時君は若かった

692
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,000
わかって欲しい　僕の心を

693
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:36,000
小さな心を　苦しめた

694
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:43,000
僕をうらまずに　いておくれ

695
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:50,000
それでも君が　望むなら

696
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:01,000
僕は待ってる　いつまでも

697
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
きっとわかって　もらえる日まで

698
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:16,000
僕は待ってる　いつまでも

699
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:45,000
 《Boku no Kokoro》

700
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,000
あの時僕も　若かった

701
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:59,000
ごめんね　君を困らせちゃって

702
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:06,000
僕の心も　苦しいんだ

703
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,000
僕を許して　欲しいんだ

704
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:20,000
それでも君が　望むなら

705
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:32,000
僕は待ってる　いつまでも

706
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:39,000
きっとわかって　もらえる日まで

707
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:46,000
僕は待ってる　いつまでも

708
01:17:46,000 --> 01:18:00,000
いつまでも

709
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
 《Boku no Kokoro》

710
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
 それでは10分間の休憩に入ります

711
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
 えーみなさん

712
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
 今日はこのステージに

713
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
 サプライズゲストとして出演できたことを

714
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
 一番嬉しく思うのと

715
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
 こんな素晴らしいお客様の前で歌えるという喜びと

716
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
 一番サプライズしてるのは私自身だったと

717
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
 いうくらい幸せな気持ちでいっぱいでございます ありがとうございます

718
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:10,000
 嬉しいです

719
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
 こんな皆さんがあの赤いユリフォンを着てね

720
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,000
 出てきてくれる私のことを歓迎してくださって 印だと思いますけど

721
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
 私こんな赤いの着たのはあの

722
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
 歓歴のちゃんちゃん子以来でございます

723
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
 ありがとうございますですけどね

724
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
 随分前に来ましたけど

725
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
 こうしてまたこの赤いこれはミリタリー ルックでございますね

726
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
 あのスパイラーズ時代ってもう今から60年ぐらい前に

727
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
 私がまだ皆さん生まれる前だと思いますが

728
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
 その頃にグループを作っておりまして

729
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
 そのグループはもうこんな人気じゃなかったもっとすごかった

730
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:58,000
 いやいやいや

731
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
 今日のお客様の本当にこの熱気

732
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
 やっぱりステージというのは半分はお客さんが作ってくれるもんだな

733
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
 そういう感じをしました今日

734
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
 素晴らしい

735
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:21,000
 僕はこのグループをそんなに近くで見ることは今までなかったんですけど

736
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
 だからグループがあるということは知ってましたけど

737
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
 一つの塊として見てましたから

738
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
 あの分からなかったよく分からなかった

739
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,000
 そうしたらこの前実は武道館のファイナル

740
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
 あの各種をで参って

741
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
 最後に外線といいますかステージとございました

742
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
 あの武道館のステージ

743
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
 あれを私初めて見させていただいたの

744
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
 そう素晴らしかった

745
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
 そん時ちょっと来てた人ちょっと手上げ

746
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
 あいたね

747
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
 2階だよね

748
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
 2階にいらっしゃったね

749
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
 だからもうあの時のこのグループ

750
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
 ソーシャルクラブ

751
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
 今まで名前も違う感じで僕覚えちゃってて

752
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
 ロックオンじゃなくてロックダウン

753
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
 ソーシャルロックダウン

754
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
 ロックオンだよね

755
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
 ロックオンだよね

756
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
 そういう素晴らしいグループが

757
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
 それで僕一番思ったのはあの時の

758
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
 このサウンドと日本語の歌詞が

759
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
 ものすごくうまくマッチしてるのを聞いて

760
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
 素晴らしいなというふうに思いました

761
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
 なかなかいないですよこういうグループは

762
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
 皆さん

763
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
 本当にこういうグループがもう本当に

764
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
 皆さん欲しいんだけど頑張って

765
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
 やってる姿を見たら僕はもう本当に

766
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
 感激するしかなかったなというのもあります

767
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
 今日もまた素晴らしいお客さんでありがとうございます

768
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
 嬉しい嬉しい嬉しい

769
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
 ありがとうございます

770
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
 全てロックオンの曲は吉田さんが

771
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
 曲をね吉田さんが書いて作ってくれて

772
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
 そうよそうよそうよ

773
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
 だからその前に皆さんの僕は名前も

774
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
分かってたんだ

775
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
 ちゃんと覚えたよ

776
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
 なりたくんでしょ

777
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
 前田くんでしょ

778
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
 高橋くんでしょ

779
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
 青山くんでしょ

780
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
 岡本くんでしょ

781
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
 わかってますよ

782
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
 それで

783
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
 お名前なんておっしゃいますか

784
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
 絶対そう落とすと思う

785
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
 絶対来る来ると思いながらドキドキします

786
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
 知ってますよ知ってますよ

787
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
 彼がいろんな曲を作ってくれて

788
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
 皆さんに提供することもあるし

789
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
 また他のアーティストに提供することもあるし

790
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
 だからある意味でもこの

791
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
 海の親の一人であるという風に言っていいと思いますね

792
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
 素晴らしい

793
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
 で

794
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
 岡本くんなんだっけ話としては

795
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
 なんでしたっけ

796
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000

797
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
 先生

798
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
 あの何ですか

799
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
 あれなんですよ

800
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
 曲を作っていただけたの

801
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
 もう言っていいんですか

802
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
 ありがとうございます

803
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
 あのですねまず

804
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
 8月ぐらいに坂井さんとお会いしたんです僕

805
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
 それでね

806
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
 私は

807
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
 スパイダーズつまり音楽からこの世界に入って

808
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
 やっぱり最後やっぱり音楽に戻りたいっていう

809
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
 熱いその思いをそこで

810
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
 もう最後になっちゃうんですか

811
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
 いやいや

812
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
 まあ音楽に戻りたいっていう

813
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
 最後にっていうのがちょっと余計だったんじゃん

814
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
 今生放送ここだけカットでお願いします

815
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
 なんかもうもうちょっとで

816
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
 何か一応みたいじゃないですか

817
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
 まあ言ってもいいっても

818
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
 健一くん余計なこと言わないと

819
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
 言わないとしてはあるんだけどさ

820
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
いつまでも

821
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
 でもその思いはすごくあったんですよ

822
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
 そうなんですそれでちょっとこの思いで

823
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
 メンバーにもこの話をして

824
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
 なんと坂井さんとロックオンで新曲作りました

825
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
 しかも来年2025年1月22日に配信します

826
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
 まだどんな曲が出てくるか

827
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
 もう一度

828
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
 もう一度

829
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000

01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
 まだどんな曲か何も知らないんです

838
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
 すいませんがこれCDとか出さないんですか

839
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
 CD欲しいですよね

840
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
 配信ってのが私なんかの年代になると

841
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
迷わないで

842
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
 できれば毎週で行ってほしいんですけど

843
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
 その曲まだもちろんのまで演奏したことないんですけども

844
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
 今日本邦初公開しても

845
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
 いいですか

846
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
 聞きたい?

847
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
 ホント?

848
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000

849
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000

ローンが終わんない

857
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
プンスカピン！

858
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000

08. BIG BAND BEAT

884
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
 We're just a BING BING BING

885
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:27,000
 You can answer this question with your free will, but if possible, please make me a member.

886
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:52,859
 Thing yoyog

887
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:03,000
 I don't think I need this group.

888
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
 I don't need it.

889
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
 I think so.

890
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
 If you're a judge,

891
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:17,000
 I'll ask you if you're okay with the recording of Masaaki Sakai.

892
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
 If you think it's okay, please tell me.

893
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
You know  偽りを

894
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:29,000
 Please do it well.

895
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
 This is the last song.

896
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
 Sakai wrote another song.

897
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
 Anyway, every generation knows Sakai.

898
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
 For example, we are the time and the best.

899
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You know  偽りを

900
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:01,000
 I think he's a showman.

901
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
 That's a good word.

902
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,000
 It's close to the word, but it's one of the words we value.

903
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:19,000
 I asked Sakai to write the song, The Showman.

904
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
 It's a very good song.

905
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
 It's a very ballad-like song.

906
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
 Please prepare a handkerchief.

907
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:39,000
 I'll sing one song and see if I can fit in the recording.

908
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
 I made a uniform.

909
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
 It's a waste to throw it away.

910
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
 It's handmade.

911
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:57,000
 So I'll sing the last song and then I'll go to the trial.

912
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
 Thank you.

913
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
 So, as I introduced earlier,

914
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
 This is my last song.

915
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
 Please listen to the song, The Showman.

916
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:48,000
 I've been through many times.

917
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:55,000
 And today someone is calling.

918
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:01,000
 It's about time.

919
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
 When I realized,

920
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:17,000
 Many friends have left.

921
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:24,000
 And now someone is calling.

922
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:31,000
 It's about time.

923
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:38,000
 Sometimes I try to make someone laugh.

924
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:45,000
 Sometimes I make someone surprised.

925
01:33:45,000 --> 01:34:03,000
 And then the showman melts into the sky like a soap bubble.

926
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:11,000
 The bell rings in the evening.

927
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:26,000
 I'm going to sing tonight.

928
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:33,000
 It's about time.

929
01:34:41,000 --> 01:35:09,000
 Sometimes I fall in love with someone.

930
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:17,000
 Sometimes I say goodbye to someone.

931
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:34,000
 But the showman's singing continues until the curtain goes down.

932
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:49,000
 The bell rings in the evening.

933
01:35:49,000 --> 01:36:00,000
 I'm going to sing tonight.

934
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:12,000
 It's about time.

935
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:24,000
 It's about time.

936
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:46,000
 It's about time.

937
01:36:46,000 --> 01:37:04,000
 Thank you.

938
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:10,000
 Now, let me announce the results of the trial.

939
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:17,000
 I, Sakaiya Sawaki, will join the Rock On Social Club.

940
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:25,000
 This is a very promising future for this group.

941
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:39,000
 If you think so, please raise your hand.

942
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:47,000
 I'm sorry, but you shouldn't raise your hand.

943
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:52,000
 If you raise your hand, I'll be excited.

944
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
 So please lower your hand.

945
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
 I'll ask you again.

946
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
 I'll join the Rock On Social Club.

947
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:12,000
 Thank you.

948
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:20,000
 Thank you.

949
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
 I'll cheer for you from the outside.

950
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
 Thank you.

951
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,000
 The winner is Sakai Masaki.

952
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:49,000
 Thank you.

953
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
 Thank you.

954
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,000
 I don't think there's an encore.

955
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,000
 And tonight's special guest, from the Rock On Social Club,

956
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:15,000
 Keiichi Okamoto, Kazeya Takahashi, and Koyo Maeda.

957
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,000
 Thank you.

958
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:30,000
 Give them a big hand.

959
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
 Thank you very much.

960
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
 Did you enjoy Yokohama?

961
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
 The title of this album, Fantasia,

962
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
 is a very chorus-like phrase.

963
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Life is like Fantasy

964
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Life is like Fantasy

965
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
 But it's also like a dream.

966
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
 That's what life is like.

967
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
 And this concert is also a reality.

968
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,000
 But tomorrow, it will be like magic.

969
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:13,000
 Our Fantasia tour will soon be over.

970
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:22,000
 We'll continue to make music so that we can meet you again tomorrow.

971
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
 Thank you again.

972
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
 I'm Tomas Simpson.

973
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:35,000
 Thank you.

974
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Stop the season in the sun

975
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,000
 there's a saying that our imagination might make someone in the future smile.

976
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:51,000
 Yes, as long as we imagine, we can create any future.

977
01:40:51,000 --> 01:41:00,000
 So let's imagine great things in 2025, and make it a great 2025.

978
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
 Thank you.

979
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:12,000
 Today is December 25, Christmas.

980
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:22,000
 So I'd like to give you a present from Naritoma.

981
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Snow White

982
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Snow White

983
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Snow White

984
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Snow White

985
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Snow White

986
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Snow White

987
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Snow White

988
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Snow White

989
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Snow White

990
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Snow White

991
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Snow White

992
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Snow White

993
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Snow White

994
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Snow White

995
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Snow White

996
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Snow White

997
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Snow White

998
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Snow White

999
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Snow White

1000
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Snow White

1001
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Snow White

1002
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Snow White

1003
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
 I can see it clearly

1004
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
 It's not because I'm crying

1005
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
 It's because I'm cold

1006
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:09,000
 While you're crying in your white clothes

1007
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,000
 I'll spread my hands in the winter sky

1008
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:22,000
 I knew it before I was born

1009
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
 It wasn't a bad song

1010
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:32,000
 It was destiny

1011
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:51,000
 Next winter, too, let's see this snow together

1012
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
 Oh

1013
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
@ YOKOHAMA BUNTAI

1014
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000

 Thank you for watching!

1019
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:12,000
 Since everyone was born

1020
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:20,000
 I'm a fairy tale hero

1021
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:29,000
 Meeting and parting repeatedly

1022
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:37,000
 Eventually I'll get old and return to heaven

1023
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:45,000
 This world may be a illusion

1024
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:52,000
 We keep running

1025
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Life is like Fantasy

1026
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:09,000
 I'm going to live while watching the dream of just one moment

1027
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Life is like Fantasy

1028
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:30,000
 Our imagination will someday change the future

1029
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Stop the season in the sun

1030
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:50,000
 Applaud and praise us

1031
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:58,000
 This world may be a illusion

1032
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:06,000
 We keep running

1033
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Life is like Fantasy

1034
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:23,000
 I'm going to live while watching the dream of just one moment

1035
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Life is like Fantasy

1036
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:43,000
 Our imagination will someday make someone smile

1037
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Life is like Fantasy

1038
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:13,000
 I'm going to live while watching the dream of just one moment

1039
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Life is like Fantasy

1040
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:41,000
 Our imagination will someday change the future

1041
01:50:50,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Life is like Fantasy

1042
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Life is like Fantasy

1043
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Life is like Fantasy

1044
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Life is like Fantasy

1045
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Life is like Fantasy

1046
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
 Thank you very much!

1047
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
 Thank you very much!

1048
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
 Merry Christmas!

1049
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
 I would like to call these people once again

1050
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
 Rock on Social Club, Takahashi, Kazuha, Maeda, Koyo, Okamoto, Kenichi!

1051
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
 Good job!

1052
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
 And...

1053
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:09,000
 And please welcome, with a big applause, Masaki Sakai!

1054
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
 Thank you!

1055
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
 Thank you!

1056
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
 Thank you!

1057
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
 I feel like I'm going to die

1058
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
 I'm going to die

1059
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
 I'm going to die

1060
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:03,000
 This world may be a illusion

1061
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:10,000
 We keep running

1062
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:17,000
 This world may be a illusion

1063
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:22,000
 We keep running

1064
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,000
 This world may be a illusion

1065
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:34,000
 This world may be a illusion

1066
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
 I'm going to die

1067
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:48,000
 I'm going to die

1068
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,000
 This world may be a illusion

1069
01:55:53,000 --> 01:56:01,000
 This world may be a illusion

1070
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:09,000
 This world may be a illusion

1071
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:18,000
 This world may be a illusion

1072
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:25,000
 We keep running

1073
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:32,000
 This world may be a illusion

1074
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
 We keep running

1075
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,000
 This world may be a illusion

1076
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:48,000
 This world may be a illusion

1077
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,000
 We keep running

1078
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
 This world may be a illusion

1079
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,000
 This world may be a illusion

1080
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
 This world may be a illusion

1081
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:32,000
 Thank you for watching!
